# Object_Detection_UsingOpenCV
This project is based on YOLO Algorithm. The object detection is built by using the OpenCV library in python. The original project is done by Sergio Canu, founder of Pysource
The Yolov3 version is used in the project. Here, we have trained our model to detect the object on the image uploaded in the code. Yolov3 is trained on the COCO dataset with 80 object classes.
